Welcome to myworks folder!

I am uploading most of my regular works/projects/practices in this folder.

My previous works are under "python_practice" folder, but works there will soon be moved into this folder.

It mainly has three sub folders:
 1. Data Science
 2. Leetcode (Algorithm)
 3. Personal_projects


Briefly speaking,

Data Science  - Usages of Pandas, Numpy, ..etc

LeetCode - Famous websites for coding practices. I use it as main source of my regular practices

Personal_projects - For fun! I am going to make something fun when I need some break from regular practices!
