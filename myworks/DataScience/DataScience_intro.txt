Welcome to my Data Science Folder!

Nothing fancy, but to keep records of my work related to Data Science/Analysis.

1. Basic/Advanced data - related libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc

2. Manipulating data into different form (often in purpose of analysis)

3. Personal practices

4. Machine Learning/Data Mining coming soon
