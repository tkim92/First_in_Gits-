This is the main directory of my GitHub page.

My first experience with Python was through the course work at school.
I would like to improve my Python programming skills
 beyond the level I reached after successfully finishing the course.


Here is the little instruction to guide my GitHub.

1. "myworks":
  The main folder of my GitHub. All my practices, projects, and codes will be uploaded here.
  Details of "myworks" folder will be provided within the folder.

2. "school_" folders:
  All school-related works

3. "theories" folder:
  Personal memo/note regard of theories (either mathematical, python, statistical, and etc)

4. "testing_folder":
  Personal testing runs. Just to verify my logic or to test a code if it runs well.

5. "python_practice":
  My former works before re-designing the structures of my GitHub.
  It will be soon updated to "myworks" folder.
